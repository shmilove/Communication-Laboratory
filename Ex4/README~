Submited files: 
		README 
		Graph.h - the header file for the graph
		Graph.c - file that contains all the function that create the graph for the ex2b
                Ex2b.h - the header file for the program. 
                Ex2b.c - file that contains all the function of the program
		main.c - the main a c file that calls the function 
		MAKEFILE - you need to write make in the command line and a test file will apear. to run the program you need to write ./test ... 			mame of the text file then name of the source Router and the time out

Additional:
				struct Vertex  - struct for all the vertex data
				struct Edge - struct for the edge data
				struct Graph - strcut for all the graph data 		
				struct Router - struct for each vertex his name and DV
				createVertex - Function that create vertex, the function gets vertex name, ip, port and the size of the dv,
	 				in the end the function returns vertex.
				createEdge -Function that get an vertexes source , destination and the weight and create the edge;
					after the edge created the function return a pointer to him
				createGraph - Function that gets vertex arry and size,  and edge arry and size, then initilaize the graph
				createRouter - Function that gets a vertex and the graph and creates a Router that saves the data of that vertex DV 						and name.
				freeGraph - Function that free the graph from the memory
				freeVertex - Function that free the vertex from the memory
				freeRouter - Function that free the router from the memory
				freeEdge - Function that free the edge from the memory	
				readFile - Function that gets file name and reads all the data in it
				getAllVertexes - Function that gets all the text data on the vertexes and create an arry.
				numberOfVertexes - Function that read in the file how many vertexes there is and returns the number
				numberOfEdges - Function that cheaks how many Edges there is in the file and returns the number
				getArryOfEdges - Function taht read all the text data on the edges and create a arry of them
				getVertex - Function that gets a vertex name search it in the arry, and return a pointer to that vertex.
				initilaize - Function that get a vertex name and initiliazle a DV for him and allso a via arry,
					after that saves the data for all the other vertexes in a diffrent struct.
				createVia - Function that create a via for a vertex
				isEqual -Function that create a DV fo r a Vertex;	
				numberOfNeighbers - Function that cheaks how many Neighbers for the vertex that given and add it to the vertex data
				createNeighbors - Function that gets a vertex and the number of his neighbors. the Function create a nieghbors arry 
					and add id to the vertex data.
				createArryDV - Function that create a arry DV, this arry saves all the DV for all the vertexes
				getAllRouters - Function that create a Router arry from the Graph data and add it to the graph data
				createDV - Function the create a DV for a vertex and add it to the vertex data
				Data - struct that contains all the data for each thread 
				DataForCalcu - struct for the data i want to send to the calculator function.
				createThreads - Function that create threads each thread gets a data struct.
				createSocket - Function that create a socket and return the the fd if the create faild the function return -1.
				receiver - Function that gets a struct data and check if need to change dv
				sender - Function that gets a struct data and send dv to all the neighbors.
				AsciiName - Function that get a string ant return the ascii value of that string
				createSocketReceiver - Function that create socket for server the function get ip port and the server name.
				calculator - 	Function that calculate the best dv, if there is no more improves from the neighbors the calculator 						ends the program.
				freeDataForCalcu - Function that free all the data in DataForCalcu struct
				findMyIndex - Function that serach a name in arry and return the index 
				initilaizeArry - Function that get an arry, and puts -1 in each cell
				findRouter - Function that gets a Router arry and a name of a Router to search in the arry, the function return a 						pointer to that Router.
				changeDv - Function that gets a new dv and replace it with the old one
				printTheEnd - Function that print the Routing table of the Vertex taht given
				getWeight - Function that serch the weight between two vertexes and return it.
